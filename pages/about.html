    <div><p class = 'description' id = 'aboutDesc'> To explain a bit more about myself, I am a mechatronics engineering student at 
		the University of Waterloo, although I am originally from Vancouver, BC. I have always enjoyed solving problems and the effort 
		that goes into that process, as I much enjoy the satisfaction and the sense of accomplishment following hard work. 
	</p></div>

    </div> -->
    <div><p  class = 'description' id = 'aboutDesc'>  My passion for the field of engineering stems from the simple desire to see actual, 
		measureable results of my efforts. My father, who is also in the discipline, used to drive me around the city, pointing out all 
		the projects he'd worked on, imbuing him (and in turn, me) with a sense of pride. I knew that I wanted that pride for myself one day,
		and decided to follow him into the field to hopefully one day attain the feeling for myself. More recently, this passion has extended
		to the field of software engineering and design, where I hope to solve problems and create solutions for the digital world today.

	<!-- To explain more about myself, I am a Chinese-Canadian from Vancouver, BC. 
	I have always enjoyed solving problems and the effort that goes into that process, 
	mostly because it makes the reward all the more sweet. My passion for the field of 
	engineering stems from the simple desire to see actual results of my problem solving efforts. 
	Of course, work is its own reward, but having an actual product to present at the end of the day 
	is a whole nother feeling.  -->
