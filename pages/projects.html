    <h1>Projects and Experience</h1>
    <p id = 'projectDesc', class = 'description'> This is a list of my past and current projects, as well as some of the experiences I've had. Some of these projects are complete, while others are still in progress. Due to NDAs, some projects listed on my resume are not shown here.</p>

        <h3>Recipe Recommender</h3>
        <img src="..\images/confusion_matrix.png" alt="My test image">
        <div class = "overlay">
          <p>A recipe recommender using a classification model trained in Python with Tensorflow. Intended to identify foods/ingredients from an image and suggest recipes, I trained a CNN to a test accuracy of 0.95 (precision, recall, and F1 0.95, 0.96, and 0.95 respectively) as well as developed the pipeline that communicated with Edamam's API. UI still in progress.</p>

        <h3>MCMC Energy Model</h3>
        <img src="..\images/MCMC.png" alt="My test image">
        <div class = "overlay">
          <p>As part of the research group Greener Productions, I helped devlop an energy model in VBA and Python simulating the daily habits of residents in a remote Ontario community. This model used conditional probabilities in a Markov Chain Monte Carlo model, simulating each resident's hourly activities based on current hour and previous activity. This model, when compared to data from Ontario's IESO, predicted loads within 5% of measured values.</p>

        <h3>Cancer Model</h3>
        <img src="..\images/LIHC.png" alt="My test image">
        <div class = "overlay">
          <p>Working for the Shenzhen Lansi Insitute of AI in Medicine, I helped to both develop and test a predictive model for determining the gene signature of TCGA-LIHC, or hepatocellular carcinoma, the primary liver cancer. This model used filtering algorithms in Perl and R such as multi/uni-COX regression and LASSO regression to compile a list of genes related to LIHC, intended for prognostic usage. The model, evaluated using an ROC curve, demonstrated an AUC of 0.805.</p>

        <h3>Skittle Sorter</h3>
        <img src="..\images/sorter.jpg" alt="My test image">
        <div class = "overlay">
          <p>This device was created as part of the MTE 100 curriculum, created in tandem with 3 other students to demonstrate the capabilities of the parts we were provided. The machine, coded in C, sorted Skittles into various coloured bins, featuring an accuracy of 100% when run over 5 minutes.</p>

        <h3>Monkey Fish</h3>
        <img src="..\images/monkeyfish.gif" alt="My test image">
        <div class = "overlay">
          <p>Monkey Fish is a 2.5D game based around fishing up monkeys following a flood. The game, developed in C# with Unity, features original pixel-art characters and environments, with plans for up to 20 different "fish" to reel in.</p>

          <h2>Pog da Dog</h2>
          <p>Pog da Dog is an interactive dogwalking simulator built in Unreal Engine 4. The core gameplay loop consists of walking your dog, as well as the various activities and interactions related to that. The game will feature various locations and minigames based on the proclivities of dog-walking.</p>
