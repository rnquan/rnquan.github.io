		I have always enjoyed solving problems and the effort that goes into that process, 
		mostly because it makes the reward all the more sweet. My passion for the field of 
		engineering stems from the simple desire to see actual results of my problem solving efforts. 
		Of course, work is its own reward, but having an actual product to present at the end of the day 
		is a whole nother feeling.
